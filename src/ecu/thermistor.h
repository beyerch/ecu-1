 *  Description:
 *  Datatypes and functions for reading thermistor temperature sensors. 
 *
*  Thermistors are passive temperature sensors that change resistance with temperature. They are
 *  exploited electrically by putting one in series with a pullup resistor. One side of the thermistor
 *  is connected to circuit ground, while one is connected to a middle node. 
 *

 *                                          /                 GND
 *
 *  The thermistor is electrically modeled by a variable resistor. its resistance is first determined
 *  from a backwards voltage divider calculation. 
 *
 *  Every thermistor has a Resistance over Temperature plot associated with it. However, the two are
 *  negatively exponentially related. To prevent excessive calculation (and because a lot of thermistors
 *  only normally have two or three data points), a linear regression must be performed to determine a 
 *  slope and intercept.
 *
 *  Since we are going from resistance back to temperature, I have named the regression parameters
 *  inverse slope and inverse y-intercept. This is because we are plotting the resistance on an 
 *  inverse Temperature over Resistance plot. All of the regression must run on an outside 
 *  calculator (for now,)
 *
 *  Note to the programmer:
 *  Please use Arduino IDE to compile / upload sketches! To use the built-in
 *  Arduino libraries, the IDE must be used. The Makefile and code directory
 *  structure is too convoluted to use.
 *
 *  TODO LIST:
 *  linear regression algorithm, run one time during setup
